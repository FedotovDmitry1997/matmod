## Who am i

- I am Fedotov Dmitriy.

- Third year student of the Rudn University

## Why do Lab 6?

Studying S.I.R model is important because:

- The simplest epidemic model is widely used to model the spread of infectious diseases.

- Such models can show how different public health interventions may affect the outcome of the epidemic, e.g., what the most efficient technique is for issuing a limited number of vaccines in a given population.

- Models try to predict things such as how a disease spreads, or the total number infected, or the duration of an epidemic, and to estimate various epidemiological parameters such as the reproductive number.

## Goal of the work

- Consider simplest compartmental model.

## Task

- Build graphs of changes in the number of individuals in each of the three groups.

- Consider how the epidemic will proceed if: $I(0) \leq I^{*}$. $I(0) > I^{*}$.

## Results

In the course of doing the work, I learned:
	
	-Build graphs of changes in the number of individuals in 
each of the three groups with different conditions.
